            <h2>About Me</h2><br>
            <p>A nutritionist is a person who advises others on matters of food and nutrition and their impacts on
                health. Some people specialize in particular areas, such as sports nutrition, public health, or animal
                nutrition, among other disciplines. In many countries, a person can claim to be a nutritionist even
                without any training, education, or professional license, in contrast to a dietitian, who has a
                university degree, professional license, and certification for professional practice.</p><br><br>
